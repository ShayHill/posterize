"""Functions to deal with image-approximation layers.

Each layer is 512 values, each either a single color index or -1.

The original colormap is 512 unique values. For each layer, 1 color index is selected
and each color in the original map is compared to it. Where the selected color index
would improve the approximation (in comparison to lower layers), the value in that
colormap position [0..511] is set to the the selected color index. Where the selected
color index would *not* improve the approximation, the value is set to -1.
