"""Create a posterized-style image from svg paths generated by potrace.

Example usage of the SvgLayers class. Some of the arguments to these functions are
slightly unintuitive.

:param input: The image to be converted to svg paths. This should be a png image with
    a transparent background. removal.ai is a good site to remove the background from
    an image.

:param output: The path to the svg file you want to create.

:param luxs: a list of illumination levels, [0, 1].

    0 is a special case where all opaque pizels are surrounded by svg paths and all
    transparent background is empty.

    As the illumination increases, the area covered by svg paths *decreases*. The
    first try might be linearly spaced illumination levels like the example. If that
    isn't capturing the details you want, try non-linear spacing.

:param cols: ["#ffffff"] Colors to fill the layers of geometry. This is the
    unintuitive part. As the illumination increases, the colors should get *darker*.
    The higher the illumination, the darker an area has to be to remain dark.

:param background: "#ffffff". The color of the background.

:param strokes: ("#ffffff", ), The colors of a stroke or strokes around the
    silhouette (illumination 0 geometry).

:param stroke_widths: the width of the strokes around the silhouette.

:param despeckle: [0, 1] optionally override the default despeckling. The
    higher the value, the less speckling. Too high, and you won't have any geometry
    at all.
