# Posterize

Posterize an image with stacked SVG geometry (generated by Potrace).

The images will require some preparation for best results:

* remove the background with any online AI background removal tool
* desaturate the image in Gimp (to improve the results of the next step)
* in Gimp, click
    * `Colors` in the top bar
    * `Levels` in the drop-down menu
    * `Auto Input Levels` in the box that appears

## requires
