This does what it is supposed to do, but doesn't give first-rate results. Better to work by hand.

Create a better posterize effect?

Call the potrace program to create svg vector files at multiple exposures.
Layer these with a darker gradient on the most exposed layers to create a
posterize-like effect without any jagged edges.

## requires

You will need a potrace binary in the binaries folder. That can be found at
[https://potrace.sourceforge.net/#downloading](https://potrace.sourceforge.net/#downloading).
